              The purpose of periodic inspection is to determine, so far as is
              reasonably practicable, whether an electrical installation is in a
              satisfactory condition for continued service. This report provides
              an assessment of the condition of the electrical installation
              identified overleaf at the time it was inspected and tested,
              taking into account the stated extent of the installation and the
              limitations of the inspection and testing.<br />
              This report has been issued in accordance with the national
              standard for the safety of electrical installations, BS 7671: 2018
              – Requirements for Electrical Installations.<br />
              The report identifies any damage, deterioration, defects and/or
              conditions found by the inspector which may give rise to danger
              (see PART 6), together with any items for which improvement is
              recommended. If you were the person ordering this report, but not
              the user of the installation, you should pass this report, or a
              full copy of it including these notes, the schedules and
              additional pages (if any), immediately to the user.<br />
              This report should be retained in a safe place and shown to any
              person inspecting or undertaking further work on the electrical
              installation in the future. If you later vacate the property, this
              report will provide the new user with an assessment of the
              condition of the electrical installation at the time the periodic
              inspection was carried out.<br />
              Where the installation incorporates a residual current device
              (RCD) there should be a notice at or near the device stating that
              it should be tested every six months. For safety reasons it is
              important that this instruction is followed.<br />
              <span style="font-weight: 900">
                For safety reasons, the electrical installation should be
                re-inspected at appropriate intervals by a skilled person or
                persons, competent in such work.<br />
              </span>
              The recommended date by which the next inspection should be
              carried out is stated in PART 5 of this report. There should also
              be a notice at or near the main switchboard or distribution
              board/consumer unit indicating when the next inspection of the
              installation is due.

              You should have received the report marked ‘Original’ and the
              contractor should have retained the report marked ‘Duplicate’.<br />
              This report form is intended to be issued only for the purpose of
              reporting on the condition of an existing electrical installation
              and must not be issued to certify new electrical installation work
              including the replacement of a distribution board or consumer
              unit.<br />
              The report consists of at least six numbered pages. Additional
              numbered pages may have been provided to permit further relevant
              information relating to the installation to be recorded. For
              installations having more than one distribution board or more
              circuits than can be recorded on PART 12, one or more additional
              Schedules of Circuit Details and Test Results should form part of
              the report. The report is invalid if any of the schedules
              identified in PART 10 are missing.

              PART 7 (Details and limitations) should identify fully the extent
              of the installation covered by this report and any limitations on
              the inspection and testing. The inspector should have agreed these
              aspects with the person ordering the report and with other
              interested parties (licensing authority, insurance company,
              mortgage

              Operational limitations may have been encountered during the
              inspection such as inability to gain access to parts of the
              installation or to an item of equipment. The inspector should have
              noted any such limitations in PART 7. It should be noted that the
              greater the limitations applying to a report, the less its value
              from the safety aspect.<br />
              A declaration should have been given by the inspector in PART 4 of
              the report. The declaration must reflect the statement given in
              PART 3, which summarises the observations and recommendations made
              in PART 6. Where one or more observations have been made in PART
              6, the Classification code given to each by the inspector
              indicates the degree of urgency with which remedial action needs
              to be taken to restore the installation to a safe working
              condition.<br />
              Where the inspector has indicated an observation as code C1
              (danger present)
              <span style="font-weight: 900"
                >the safety of those using the installation is at risk.</span
              >
              Wherever practicable, items classified as (C1) should be made safe
              on discovery, and it is recommended that a skilled person(s)
              competent in electrical installation work undertakes the necessary
              remedial work immediately.<br />
              Where the inspector has indicated an observation as code C2
              (potentially dangerous)
              <span style="font-weight: 900"
                >the safety of those using the installation may be at
                risk,</span
              >
              and it is recommended that a skilled person(s) competent in
              electrical installation work undertakes the necessary remedial
              work as a matter of urgency.<br />
              Where the inspector has indicated that an item requires further
              investigation (FI), the investigation should be carried out
              without delay to determine whether danger or potential danger
              exists. For further guidance on the Classification codes, please
              see the reverse of page 2.<br />
              Where the installation can be supplied by more than one source,
              such as the public supply and a standby generator or
              microgenerator, this should be identified in PART 8 Supply
              Characteristics and Earthing Arrangements, and the Schedules of
              Circuit Details and Test Results (PART 12) compiled
              accordingly.<br />
              Where inadequacies in the intake equipment have been observed
              (Item 1 of PART 10), the person ordering the inspection should
              inform the distributor and/or supplier as appropriate.<br />
              Should the person ordering this report have reason to believe that
              it does not reasonably reflect the condition of the electrical
              installation reported on, that person should in the first instance
              raise the specific concerns in writing with the contractor.
